@article{ccs07,
	Abstract = {


In recent years, a large number of identity-based key agreement
protocols from pairings have been proposed. Some of them are
elegant and practical. However, the security of this type of
protocol has been surprisingly hard to prove, even in the random
oracle model.
The main issue is that a simulator is not able to deal with reveal queries,
because it requires solving either a computational problem or a decisional
problem, both of which are generally believed to be hard (i.e.,
computationally infeasible). The best solution so far for security proofs
uses the gap assumption, which means assuming
that the existence of a decisional oracle does not change the
hardness of the corresponding computational problem. The
disadvantage of using this solution to prove security is that such
decisional oracles, on which the security proof relies, cannot be
performed by any polynomial time algorithm in the real world,
because of the hardness of the decisional problem.
In this paper we present a method
incorporating a built-in decisional function into the protocols.
The function transfers a hard decisional problem in the
proof to an easy decisional problem. We then discuss the resulting
efficiency of the schemes and the relevant security reductions, in
the random oracle model, in the context of different pairings one can use.
We pay particular attention, unlike most other papers in the area, to the
issues which arise when using asymmetric pairings.},

	Abstract = {
The only known blind signature scheme that is secure in the standard
 model~\cite{juels97security} is based on general results about
 multi-party computation, and thus it is extremly inefficient.
 The main  result of this paper is the first  provably secure blind
 signature  scheme which is also efficient.
 We  develop our construction as  follows.
 In the first  step, which  is a  significant result on its
 own,  we devise and prove  the  security of  a new variant for the
 Cramer-Shoup-Fischlin signature  scheme.
 We are able to show that  for generating signatures, instead  of
 using randomly chosen  \textit{prime} exponents one can securely  use
 randomly chosen \textit{odd integer} exponents which significantly
 simplifies  the signature generating  process.
 We obtain our blind signing function as a secure and efficient two-party
 computation that cleverly exploits its algebraic properties and those
 of the Paillier encryption scheme.
 The security of the resulting signing  protocol relies on the Strong
 RSA  assumption and the hardness of  decisional composite
 residuosity; we stress that it does not rely on the existence of
 random oracles.},
